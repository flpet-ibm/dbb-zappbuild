# Contribution Guidelines

* Read and agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/blob/development/DCO1.1.txt) document.
* Fork this repository and Create a Pull Request
    * Fork the dbb-zappbuild repo, create a new topic branch from `main` and apply your changes there. Create a Pull Request from your topic branch against the dbb-zappbuild `main` branch.
    * Limit each Pull Request to one enhancement or bug fix. Don't bundle multiple enhancements/changes (e.g. a new enhancement and a fix to an existing sample) into a single Pull Request - create one PR for the new enhancement, and a separate PR for the fix.
    * For complex changes, try to squash your changes into a single commit. Don't worry if you have missed that, the reviewer can squash the commits when merging your PR.
* Send an email to drbruce@us.ibm.com with a link to the Pull Request and the following statement:

    ```
    DCO 1.1 signed-off-by: Random J Developer random@developer.org.
    ```
